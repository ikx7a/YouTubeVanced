🤔 How to Install and Use Youtube Vanced Post - Shutdown❓

1. Download Vanced Manager from [here](https://github.com/ikx7a/VancedManager/releases/download/2.6.2/VancedManager.apk)

2. Open Vanced Manager, tap the three dots and press "About"

3. Repeatedly tap the bottom of the screen until it says developer options unlocked check image.

4. Tap the three dots again, tap settings then click the ⚙️ at the top

5. Go "Channel URL" and Replace the Link with `https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafybeib3qysjp22pj7sqimzzm4jzpbemnmnca4nhwjcd6a5eyo3xywebyy/api/v1`

🔥 Boom! Now You can download Official Vanced again by leaving other suspicious apps present on internet.

What this allows you to do is change your Update Channel in Vanced Manager to use a public IPFS gateway so you can install Vanced as if their servers were up.

🤔 What if above provided link is dead❓
